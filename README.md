# Music-Quiz
A music quiz website that allows users to create their own quizzes, and play quizzes from other users.

## Description

This web app allows its users to play quizzes created by themselves and other users. 


## What was the motivation?

To demonstrate all the various skills I've learned during my time studying at Monash. I wanted to prove my knowledge in using the MERN stack to create a fully functioning web app. 

It just so happens that I really enjoy listening to music, so I decided to show my skills by creating a music quiz.


## What problems does it solve?

Forgetting the lyrics to your favourite songs? What better way to memorise something than by taking a test!

Users can create quizzes for any songs they desire, and choose any lyric from said song to test their knowledge. Other users can also take the same quizzes so they can compare their knowledge. This is possible through a point system that records the amount of questions that were correct, and the amount that were incorrect.


## What did you learn?

This was a good recap to all that we've learned in regards to the 6 month Monash coding bootcamp. Applying the MERN stack taught me a lot on how the database and the back-end interact with the front-end. I feel more confident with React now, especially with hooks. And also with Mongoose, I feel the most confident with data and handling MongoDB.

This was all a very eye-opening experience in how one can create a web app from basically nothing. Can't wait to reapply this knowledge, and more, in another passion project!
