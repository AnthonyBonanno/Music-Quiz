# Music-Quiz
A music quiz website that allows users to create their own quizzes, and play quizzes from other users.

## Description

This web app allows its users to play quizzes created by themselves and other users. 


## What was the motivation?

To demonstrate all the various skill I've learned during my time studying at Monash. I wanted to prove my knowledge in using the MERN stack to create a web site. It just so happens that I really enjoy listening to music, and so I decided to show my skills by created a music quiz.


## What problems does it solve?

Forgetting the lyrics to your favourite songs? What better what to memorise something than by taking a test!

Users can create quizzes for any songs they desire, and choose any lyric from said song to test their knowledge. Other users can also take the same quizzes so they can compare their knowledge. This is possible through a point system that records the amount of questions that were correct, and the amount that were incorrect.
